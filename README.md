### Requirements :arrow_down:

| Requirement | Progress |
|-------------|----------|
|      The application must follow the MVC pattern. Try to distribute responsibilities in a correct manner between Model (Product (s) and Cart), Views (JSP), Controllers (Servlets) and classes.                                   |   :heavy_check_mark:   |
|       The application must support three different locations, each consisting of language + country.          |   :heavy_check_mark:   |
|        The application must be internationalized so that there is only one JSP per web page.                 |   :heavy_check_mark:   | 
|        The application must be internationalized so that a new place can be added without having to change the code. (Not easy to get this to 100%. Try as best you can.)    | :x: |
Application texts should be stored in a resource bundle (properties files).    | :heavy_check_mark:|       
The amounts must be converted from Euros (reference value) to the correct value for selected country.      |     :x:     |
|       JSTL/fmt should be used to display general application texts and for formatting data.      |    :heavy_check_mark:      |
|      Initial location should be obtained from a cookie, or. HTTP header if no cookie is set.       |   :heavy_check_mark:       |
|      When you change location during a session a cookie should be sent to the client.        |     :heavy_check_mark:     |
|       It is not necessary to use a database system (RDBMS). It's okay to make a mock DAO containing hard-coded data about products and product descriptions.       |  :heavy_check_mark:        |
|       The application must know which locations that are supported, ie it must be an object that gives this information.      |     :heavy_check_mark:     |
|       Copyright-line shall be generated by a custom tag. Example: HVL shall give © MMVIIIMMXIX HVL (ie the “since year” and the current year shall be written in Roman numerals)      |   :heavy_check_mark:   |
|      Product descriptions in the database can be arbitrarily long. In the carts summary, we want to limit the length of these descriptions. You must create a custom tag for this. Example:  asødlk aøsdlkaøslølskdøaksdøaksd  shall give asødlk aøs ... (ie 10 characters of text plus "spacde dot dot dot"). If the text is shorter than "maxchars", the entire text is returned as it is. Otherwise, there should be minimal cut and paste in the code.|  :heavy_check_mark: |
 
### Assignment 2.1 :arrow_down: 
Write a Java application (not web application) for the store. The store should contain the products
and cart and should be internationalized localized to three locations. No GUI (graphical user
interface) is needed, use the console for user interaction. Do not create the custom tags, but you
should write code for the functionality for copyright and shorttext.

### Assignment 2.2 :arrow_down:
Change the code from 2.1 to become a web application for the store. Do not create the custom
tags

### Assignment 2.3 :arrow_down:
Add the custom tags.
